agogosml is a data processing pipeline project that addresses the common
need for operationalizing ML models. This covers the complete workflow
of training, deploying, scoring and monitoring the models in production
at scale. 


Features
========

-  Re-usable/canonical data processing pipeline supporting multiple data streaming technologies (Kafka and Azure EventHub) and deployment to Kuberentes.
-  CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy versioned and immutable pipeline.
-  Blue/Green deployments, automatic role-backs or redeployment of a specific version.


Roadmap
=======

-  Dashboard to explore real-time and historical model input, predictions and performance
-  Model monitoring to detect unexpected changes in input data and predictions
-  Triggers to take actions if input or predictions diverge from expected ranges
-  Anonymize/remove PII data and keep track of PII data used for model training
-  Revoke and retrain models if certain records need to be removed due to customers that want their data revoked
