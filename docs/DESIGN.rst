Data Pipeline Building Block
----------------------------

The following is a basic, data pipeline, building block consisting of an
<input, app, output> sequence. The input/output containers implement
connectors to various messaging services and act as a message proxy
between the messaging services and the app container. This sequence
removes the need to implement connectors to various messaging services,
and focus on building the business logic inside the app container while
implementing a loosely coupled services approach.

-  Input container - Receive events from Azure Event Hub / Kafka
-  Customer App - Models implemented in PySpark, Tensorflow,
   scikit-learn and R.
-  Output container - send the results of the models to Azure Event Hub
   / Kafka or other data source.

CI/CD Pipeline
--------------

The CI/CD pipeline runs in Azure DevOps Pipelines. It consists of two
separate pipelines, The Customer application and the Input/Output
applications.

Each pipeline is triggered on code commit or PR:

-  Clones the latest (or specific) branch of a Github repository.
-  Build the repo.
-  Run linting and unit tests.
-  If all the tests have passed, push the new docker images to an Azure
   Container Registry.

Data Pipeline - Production Architecture
---------------------------------------

The production architecture leverages the concept of `Kubernetes
pods <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/>`__ to
host and connect between the Input/Output containers and the customer
container. Seperating the input container and application and output
containers enables a rolling upgrade and Blue / Green deployment without
downtime.

Data Pipeline - Test Architecture
---------------------------------

The test architecture runs both unit tests and integration tests locally
on the test machine - In our case, the Azure DevOps machine. It runs the
tested containers as well as the testing helper containers locally,
while the testing container are responsible for pushing data into the
pipeline and checking that the data coming from the other end of the
pipeline is as expected.

Data Pipeline Building Block Description
----------------------------------------

The following is a detailed description of the Data Pipeline Building
Block and all the elements connecting between the different containers
in this block.

Release Pipeline
----------------

This Azure DevOps pipeline is responsible to build, validate and create
new docker images of the data pipeline which will be deployed using
another dedicated pipeline aka Release pipeline.

The release pipeline is focused on deploying the input, customer app and
output containers and implementing B/G deployment **only** on the
customer app.

B/G deployment enables the data scientist to verify the new model (Blue)
without tearing down the old model (Green). Once the new model is
approved, the old model will be deleted and the new model will be marked
"Green"

The deployment is done via `Helm <https://helm.sh>`__ chart and Azure
DevOps release pipeline with manual approval process of the version.
