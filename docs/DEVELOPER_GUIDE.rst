Setting up the Agogosml Library for Development
-----------------------------------------------

Requirements to Run Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Make sure to run bash (Linux/MacOS) or `WSL`_
-  Install `azure-cli`_
-  `Python 3.7`_
-  `Docker`_
-  Optional: `Terraform`_ to provision Azure resources such as AKS and EventHub

Project Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``agogosml_cli/`` is all code related to the CLI, i.e. generating the pipeline project locally for a user. 
``agogosml/agogosml_cli/cli/templates/{{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}}/`` contains the structure that is generated. 
The ``templates/apps/`` folder has the two sample applications, one of which will be selected to create the pipeline with.

The pipeline generated simply uses a base image of Agogosml available in PyPi. You can use the commands in `dockerbuild.sh` to build
the input, output, and application Docker containers. If changes are made within this CLI implementation, to test you can simply run 
the end-to-end tests, using the docker-compose files we provide. These compose files spin up all three images, and send test messages
from another ``testgen`` container that is built in the compose.  

In the CLI we also have infrastructure deployment, Helm charts for Kubernetes orchestration, and end-to-end tests.

The code for Agogosml lives in ``agogosml/agogosml/``. To test the pipeline with your local version, simply
build ``agogosml/Dockerfile.agogosml`` as your base image before building the input, output, and app containers. The 
instructions are in the below section.

To test locally, create a virtual environment within agogosml and install the package.

.. code:: bash

    cd agogosml/agogosml
    python3 -m venv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    cd ..
    pip install -e agogosml/

The final step installs agogosml as if it were a remote package. This way you can locally
test changes immediately.

Build the Pipeline with Docker using your Local Version of Agogosml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the top level directory, build the base image using. You can add a --build-arg CONTAINER_REG=
to any of these commands, but unsure to tag your base image with the CONTAINER_REG/. 

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t agogosml -f agogosml/Dockerfile.agogosml agogosml

Now navigate to the CLI at ``agogosml/agogosml_cli/cli/templates/{{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}}/``
Build the input reader and output writer image: 

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t agogosml/input_reader -f input_reader/Dockerfile.input_reader input_reader/
    docker build -t agogosml/output_writer -f output_writer/Dockerfile.output_writer output_writer/


Now navigate to the CLI at ``agogosml/agogosml_cli/cli/templates/{{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}}/``
Build the custom application:

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t agogosml/{{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}} -f {{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}}/Dockerfile.{{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}} {{cookiecutter.PROJECT_NAME_SLUG}}/


Run with Docker Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set required environment variables in the PATH (You can see an example `env.example.sh <../env.example.sh>`__)

Below are the required variables to run the ``docker-compose-agogosml.yml`` file locally. We hardcode
some of the enviromment variables there, so if you want to run each container separately, please refer
to ``env.example.sh``.

.. code:: bash

    export MESSAGING_TYPE=eventhub        # eventhub/kafka

    # Event Hub Specific Variables 

    export MESSAGING_TYPE=                          # eventhub/kafka
    export CONTAINER_REG=                           # this can be empty for local dev.
    export TAG=                                     # latest

    # Fill out if using Event Hubs as messaging service.
    export EVENT_HUB_NAMESPACE=
    export EVENT_HUB_NAME_INPUT=                    # Event Hub to receive incoming messages
    export EVENT_HUB_NAME_OUTPUT=                   # Event Hub to receive outgoing messages
    export EVENT_HUB_SAS_POLICY=                    # SAS Policy created for both input and output
    export EVENT_HUB_SAS_KEY_INPUT=                 # Key for input event hub SAS policy
    export EVENT_HUB_SAS_KEY_OUTPUT=                # Key for output event hub SAS policy

    export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=                   # Storage account for Event Hub
    export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=
    export LEASE_CONTAINER_NAME_INPUT=              # Container for input events
    export LEASE_CONTAINER_NAME_OUTPUT=             # Container for output events
    export EVENT_HUB_CONSUMER_GROUP=                # Default is $default

    # Fill out if using Kafka as messaging service, including Kafka with Event Hubs Integration
    export KAFKA_ADDRESS=
    export KAFKA_TIMEOUT=
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_INPUT=
    export KAFKA_TOPIC_OUTPUT=
    export KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP=

    # Fill out the following if using Kafka Enabled Event Hubs Only. See instruction https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled.
    # Ensure that EVENTHUB_KAFKA_CONNECTION_STRING is NOT set if you are using pure Kafka.

    export EVENTHUB_KAFKA_CONNECTION_STRING=        # Connection string-primary key in the Event Hub

    # Local SSL Certificate - only necessary to define path to local cert if you are running locally. i.e. something like /usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem
    
    export SSL_CERT_LOCATION=
