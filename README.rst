Intro
=====

agogosml is a data processing pipeline project that addresses the common
need for operationalizing ML models. This covers the complete workflow
of training, deploying, scoring and monitoring the models in production
at scale. The key focus will be on production ready re-training and
scoring. The taken approach will be agnostic to the data science
workflow of building the models, but the initial project will be scoped
towards traditional ML techniques (non deep-learning) but might be
extended when required/requested through additional customer
engagements.

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Make sure to run on bash or `Windows
   Bash <https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10>`__
-  `Create an SSH key on
   bash <https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows>`__
-  Install
   `azure-cli <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest>`__

-  Run ``make requirements`` - Install Python requirements Python
   packages.

Projects
--------

This solution consists of two projects; - `agogosml <./agogosml>`__: The
agogosml library sdk which consists of the data pipeline, input reader,
output writer, streaming clients, etc. -
`agogosml\_cli <./agogosml_cli>`__: A cli meant to help you set up a new
project via cli

Installing prerequisites
------------------------

Windows
~~~~~~~

::

    sudo apt-get install pipenv
