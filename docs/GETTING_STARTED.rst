Getting Started
===============

This solution consists of three projects:

-  `Framework`_ - The agogosml library SDK which consists of the data
   pipeline, input reader, output writer, streaming clients, etc.
-  `CLI`_: A CLI tool to help you set up a new project.
-  ` App`_: An app that represent the customer app/model

Before starting, please review agogosml `design`_

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Make sure to run bash (Linux/MacOS) or `WSL`_
-  Install `azure-cli`_
-  `Python 3.7`_
-  `Terraform`_ to provision Azure resources such as AKS and EventHub
-  `Docker`_

Setup up Development environment
--------------------------------

1. Install the CLI ``$ pip install agogosml``

2. Init the project ``$ agogosml init <folder name>``

3. Generate the code for the project. ``$ agogosml generate``. The
   generated folder structure is described `here`_ and consist with the
   input, customer app and output app as well as the Azure DevOps pipelines
   for CI/CD.

App/Model Integration with Agogosml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrate your model in Agogosml by implementing a small HTTP service
that accepts POST requests and can send the HTTP POST request to
agogosml output writer. You can find an example
`here <https://github.com/Microsoft/agogosml/tree/master/sample_app>`__.

Build and test your app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to test your app integration with the agogosml components aka
Input/Output, you can build Docker containers with the following
`instructions`_

Provision Azure Resources
-------------------------

1. Create `Azure DevOps`_ account
2. Create `Azure Kubernetes Service`_
3. Create `Azure Event Hub`_
