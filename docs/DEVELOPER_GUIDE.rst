Setting up the Agogosml Library for Development
-----------------------------------------------



Setting up the CLI for Development
----------------------------------

agogosml_cli is a cli tool developed with Python using the
`Click\_ <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/>`__ in combination
with `cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`__. 

To get started with the project, it is recommended you install `pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>` 
as we use Pipfiles to list dependencies. The project currently requires Python 3.7 (we may add backward compatibility
over time). We do not support Python 2 and nor do we plan on it. 

Installing Dependencies (and Dev Dependencies):

.. code:: bash

    $ cd agogosml_cli/
    $ pipenv install --dev

Running Tests:

.. code:: bash

    $ pipenv run make test

Running Linter:

.. code:: bash

    $ pipenv run make lint
